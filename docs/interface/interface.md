# Graphical interface
{: .no_toc}
The main graphical interface is CellExplorer, which allows you to explore your data on a single cell level. There are also two other important graphical interfaces: [gui_session](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/gui_session/) (for inspecting and entry of session-level metadata) and [NeuroScope2](https://cellexplorer.org/interface/neuroscope2/) (a data viewer for extracellular data). The sections below describes the primary graphical interfaces.
